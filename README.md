# Monday
An end to end speech to speech model using Tensorflow and Keras


# STEP 1 - Speech to Text
Step one will be creating a model that takes the inputed audio file and converts it to text for the computer to understand

# STEP 2 - Understanding the Text
Step two will consist of a Reccurrent Neural Network in order for the computer to undertand what the text is saying and what actions to user wants to take

# STEP 3 - Text to Speech
Step three will consist of taking the computer's generated text and converting it to an audio output
